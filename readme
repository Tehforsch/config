# Spotify
Spotify doesnt start because of libgcrypt11? installing with apt doesnt help, use the .deb in install folder instead.

# Sound
18i6 no sound but "crackling" whenever activated? try activating the outputs in alsamixer, the monitors are actually the outputs since this is recognized now.
The desired output (=guitar + sound from pc) is probably MIX1, one of the last options
