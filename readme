# Spotify
Use https://github.com/olejon/spotcommander/wiki/DowngradeSpotify for the 0.9 version 

# Sound
18i6 no sound but "crackling" whenever activated? try activating the outputs in alsamixer, the monitors are actually the outputs since this is recognized now.
The desired output (=guitar + sound from pc) is probably MIX1, one of the last options

the wifi module is the cause of the skips

# Graphics
Apparently nvidia-352 works with 840M only if i upgrade everything before
